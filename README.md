## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based system that can classify skin diseases based on images. By training the model on a large dataset of images, the system aims to identify various skin conditions accurately. This could aid dermatologists and healthcare professionals in making faster diagnoses.

## Installation Instructions

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed, along with some specific libraries and dependencies. You can set up the environment as follows:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-disease-classification.git
   cd skin-disease-classification
2. Install the required dependencies:
   '''bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of skin diseases, with each image belonging to one of several categories. The data includes various skin conditions such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, and more. The images are pre-labeled, and the goal is to classify these diseases using deep learning techniques.

Dataset source: Kaggle Skin Disease Dataset

Preprocessing
Before training the model, several preprocessing steps are applied to the images to enhance performance:

Resize: The images are resized to a consistent size.
Normalization: Image pixel values are scaled to a range of [0, 1].
Augmentation: Data augmentation techniques like rotation, zooming, and flipping are applied to increase the model's robustness.
Model Architecture
The model used for classification is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), chosen for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by dense layers:

Conv2D Layers: These layers extract features from the images.
MaxPooling Layers: These layers downsample the image representation.
Dense Layers: These layers make the final predictions based on the extracted features.

Training
To train the model, run the following command:
'''bash
python train.py
The training process includes the following steps:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
Training the CNN model using the training set.
Evaluating the model using the validation set.
Saving the trained model to a file.
Results
Once trained, the model is evaluated on a test dataset, and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed.

The final results include:
Accuracy: The percentage of correct classifications.
Confusion Matrix: A table showing the actual vs predicted classifications.
ROC Curve: A plot showing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
